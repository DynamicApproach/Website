              My printer was originally an Ender 3 (when they were first
              released) and consisted of the default parts. I quickly modified
              it to be able to print faster with an increased range of
              materials. This led to an increasing amount of modifications.
              <br />
              Essentially, the only parts left the same, were the stepper
              moters, the frame and the power supply.

              My latest printer is an Elegoo Saturn 2. This is a resin printer
              that uses UV light to cure resin. It has a much higher resolution
              than my FDM printer and is much faster. It is also much more
              expensive to run.
              <br />I have printed a few things on it - the main reason it was
              purcahsed was to print the parts for a new printer and for my
              Ender 3.
